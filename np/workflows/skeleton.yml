# input userID, mouseID
    
# get experiment-type from mouseID/lims project name, confirm experiment
    
# check components reqd for experiment are on: Cameras, Ephys, Stim, Sync/DAQ,
# Servers, Filesystem space
    
# optional resume previous unfinished workflow

# reminders + manual checks (open ephys config, flush water lines, lick spout)

# position probes in dye, capture photodoc, await timer

# load mouse onto stage

# capture brain surface photodoc

# position probes at surface, notes, capture pre-insertion photodoc

# insert, capture post-insertion photodoc, await settle timer 

# extend lickspout, initiate behavior experiment (data streams but not stimulus)

# start stimulus, monitor data streams

# capture post-experiment photodoc

# remove probes, capture post-removal photodoc

# remove mouse while files are processed/moved/backed-up, kick-off addtl pipelines
