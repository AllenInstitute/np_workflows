required screens: 
  - ephys: 
    (manually check config: probe letters, 2 record nodes writing to A/B drives, 50/50 channels de-selected, tip-ref)
  - mvr
  - camstim (no screen)
  - sync (no sync)
  - newscale
  - smartmotor

pretest start, stop, check data:
  - ephys 
  - mvr
  - camstim, visual confirmation of laser on #! how to specify params when called via camstim agent
  - sync

# fetch mouse, implant/well prep
# retract probes from tergazyme, remove well etc

exp wfl:

# input userID, mouseID

# get experiment-type from mouseID/lims project name, confirm experiment

# check components reqd for experiment are on: Cameras, Ephys, Stim, Sync/DAQ,
# Servers, Filesystem space

# optional resume previous unfinished workflow

# reminders + manual checks (open ephys config, flush water lines, lick spout)

# position probes in dye, capture photodoc, await timer

#* everything pre- mouse loading should be done by here
# load mouse onto stage, 
# stabilization screw
# quickcast off, agarose/silicon oil
# tail cone down 
# continuity/resistance test 

# capture brain surface photodoc  #! don't miss before moving probes in!

# position probes at surface, any insertion notes (probes skipped)
# capture pre-insertion photodoc (primarily for targetting)

trial loop:
  # insert ~250microns, retract 30microns, await settle timer (10-15mins)
  # capture post-insertion photodoc
  # initiate data streams but not stimulus, verify recording
  #* exp start 
  # start stimulus, monitor data streams
  #* exp end
  # capture post-experiment photodoc
  # option to break out of trial loop

# remove probes
# capture post-removal photodoc
# stage up

# remove agarose/silicon oil, add quickcast
# remove mouse while 
# files are processed/moved/backed-up
# kick-off addtl pipelines
